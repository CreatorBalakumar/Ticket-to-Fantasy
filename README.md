# Ticket-to-Fantasy
This Ticket to Fantasy is in PHP, CSS, JavaScript. Talking about the features of the Cinema Seat Reservation system, it contains both the admin section and the user section. The user can book the hall seat, while the admin can view all bookings and manage them. The design of this project is pretty simple so that the user wonâ€™t find any difficulties while working on it.
